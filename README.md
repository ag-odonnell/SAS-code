# SAS
## SAS Code Repository (sas-code-repo)
### Overview
This repository is used to store SAS code created for various projects. It will also contain a Snippet container that will store self-contained SAS code used to test various SAS procedures, macro statements and general logic. The repo is divided into two main directories: SAS Projects and SAS Snippets.

-	SAS Projects contain generic code that can be repurposed for specific applications.
-	SAS Snippets contains self-contained code that tests SAS features and coding logic.
