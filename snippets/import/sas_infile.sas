/*
To import a CSV file in SAS using the infile statement, 
where col1 is numeric and col2 is a character field with leading zeros that should not be removed, 
you can use the following code. This ensures that col2 is read as a character string, preserving the leading zeros.

Here's an example SAS code to accomplish this:
*/

data mydata;
    infile '/path/to/your/file.csv' dsd firstobs=2; /* Adjust the path to your CSV file */
    input col1 col2 $3.; /* col1 is numeric, col2 is character (length 3) */
run;

/*
Explanation:
- infile '/path/to/your/file.csv': Specifies the path to your CSV file.
- dsd: Treats consecutive delimiters correctly and recognizes the delimiter within quotes.
- firstobs=2: Skips the first row if it contains headers. Adjust as necessary.
- input col1 col2 $3.: Defines the input format where col1 is numeric, and col2 is a character variable of length 3, preserving any leading zeros.
- This code should import your CSV file into the mydata dataset with the leading zeros in col2 retained.
